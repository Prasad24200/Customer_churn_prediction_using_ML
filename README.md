# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Prediction

## âœ… Objective

This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (leave) a telecom company based on historical data. By analyzing patterns and applying machine learning models, we can help businesses retain customers more effectively.

## ðŸ§ª Problem Statements Solved

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant features.
- Encoded categorical variables using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
- Scaled features to ensure consistent input to models.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions of features like tenure, contract type, and internet usage.
- Analyzed churn behavior across customer segments.
- Correlation analysis to identify important features.

### 3. Model Building & Training
- Applied multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Evaluated using metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Compared model performance and selected the best based on accuracy and interpretability.
- Analyzed false positives and false negatives for business implications.

### 5. Business Insights
- Identified key drivers of churn.
- Suggested actionable strategies to reduce churn rate.
